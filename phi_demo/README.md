# Phi Number Demonstration

This project demonstrates the Phi number (ϕ), also known as the Golden Ratio, as the positive solution of a quadratic function. This function arises from dividing a segment in extreme and mean ratio. The visualization is created using Manim, an animation engine for explanatory math videos.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an animated illustration of how the Phi number emerges from the division of a line segment into extreme and mean ratio. The Golden Ratio, often denoted by the Greek letter ϕ (phi), is a special number approximately equal to 1.6180339887. It appears in various areas of mathematics, art, architecture, and nature.

### Key Concepts

- **Golden Ratio (ϕ)**: Defined as the positive solution to the quadratic equation x² - x - 1 = 0.
- **Extreme and Mean Ratio**: A line segment is divided into two parts such that the ratio of the whole segment to the longer part is equal to the ratio of the longer part to the shorter part.

### Visualization Steps

1. **Introduction**: The segment is shown and labeled.
2. **Division**: The segment is divided into two parts.
3. **Quadratic Function**: The relationship is established through the quadratic function.
4. **Solution**: The positive solution (Phi) is highlighted.
